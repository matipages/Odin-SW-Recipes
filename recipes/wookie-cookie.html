        <h2>BAKE SOME WOOKIEE COOKIE BROWNIES FOR A DELICIOUS LIFE DAY DESSERT</h2>
            <p><strong>Life Day</strong> is among the Star Wars galaxy’s most beloved holidays, and one that Star Wars fans honor every 
                November 17. 
                If you’re looking to whip, whip, stir something up to mark the occasion, look no further.</p>

            <p>Life Day began as a Wookiee holiday centered around the Kashyyyk Tree of Life. 
                These Wookiee Cookie Brownies, an ideal Life Day dessert, are frosted to resemble the Kashyyyk natives 
                and have a secret sweet center that will have you saying, “Rrraahh, aaarrgg,” 
                in the Wookiee language of Shyriiwook that means, “More, please.”</p>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Prep a muffin pan with 9 liners.</li>
                            <li>In a bowl, whisk together cocoa powder, brown sugar, granulated sugar, flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                            <li>Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and stir in butter, eggs, and vanilla, until just combined.</li>
                            <li>Pour a tablespoonful batter into the prepped liners. Place a cookie on top, then cover with more batter, covering the cookie completely.</li>
                            <li>Bake for 18 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack.</li>
                            <li> In a bowl, use a handheld mixer to cream the butter and powdered sugar.</li>
                            <li>Add the cocoa powder, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt.</li>
                            <li>Add the milk until you get a thick but pipeable consistency.</li>
                            <li>Spoon the frosting into a piping bag. With a large star piping tip, start at the top and pull upwards to form the forehead. Then pipe from the middle out all around the brownie to complete the rest of the fur.</li>
                            <li>Use the black and white icings to create the face details.</li>
                            <li>Once the icing is dry the brownies are ready to serve.</li>
                        </ol>
