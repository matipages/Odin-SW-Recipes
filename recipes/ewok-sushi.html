        <h2>LEARN AN EASY RECIPE INSPIRED BY THE GALAXY'S GREATEST FURRY COMPANIONS.</h2>
            <p>It’s time to celebrate <strong>Ewoks!</strong> The furry friends from the forest moon of Endor are tiny but tough and sometimes worship a golden god. While their allegiance may be misdirected, they are steadfast allies always willing to lend a helping hand.</p>

            <p>Though they are carnivorous creatures who’s to say they wouldn’t dabble in a vegetarian lifestyle now and again? These seasoned tofu pockets filled with brown rice look just like the pint-sized warriors and are just as tasty as they are adorable.</p>

                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1 package aburaage tofu pouches</li>
                            <li>1 sweet seaweed</li>
                            <li>1 slice salami</li>
                            <li>2 cups brown rice</li>
                            <li>3 cups water</li>
                            <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar</li>
                            <li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
                            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                            </ul>
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Rinse the brown rice until water runs clear. Soak in cold water for 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
                            <li>In a large saucepan add the rice and 3 cups of water. Bring to a boil.</li>
                            <li>Cover and reduce heat, then simmer for 20 minutes until the water is absorbed. Remove from heat, let sit for 10 minutes, covered.</li>
                            <li>Transfer the rice into a medium bowl and fold in the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Let cool slightly.</li>
                            <li>Prepare tofu pouches according to the package.</li>
                            <li>Pull apart each pouch and stuff with the rice mixture.</li>
                            <li>Cut the corners off both sides of the pouch and push the rice through to form the fluffy ears.</li>
                            <li>Use kitchen shears to cut away the middle part of the pouch to reveal a face area.</li>
                            <li>Cut or punch out seaweed to create eyes and a nose, and cut a small piece of salami for the mouth.</li>
                            <li>Place onto the rice balls to serve.</li>
                        </ol>
